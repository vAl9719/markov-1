Q1: Run WordGramBenchmark for wordgrams of size 2-10 and record
the number of WordGram values/objects that occur more than
once as reported by the runs. For example, with WSIZE = 2,
which generates 2-grams, the output of benchmark and benchmarkShift
each indicates that the total # wordgrams generated is 177,634
and that the # unique wordgrams is 117,181

This means there are 177,634 - 117,181 = 60,453 WordGram values that
occur more than once. Find these same numbers/values for other orders
of k and complete the table below for different k-grams/different
values of WSIZE

WSIZE    # duplicates
2        60,453
3        10,756
4         1,987
5           667
6           362
7           226
8           151
9           105
10

Q2: Explain in your own words the conceptual differences between
the benchmark and benchmarkShift methods.
Answer these questions:

(1) Why the results of these methods should be the same in
terms of changes made to the HashSet parameter passed to each method.

(2) What are the conceptual differences between the two
benchmarking method
